I'm an early-career researcher with a background in computer and data science, interested in applied AI. In the past I've worked on educational and medical (incl. medicinal chemistry) applications of language models. I'm especially interested in the intersection of graphs and language (e.g. semantic graphs like AMR/UMR, knowledge graphs, chemical graphs, etc.), as sequential language models struggle to leverage structural information from text.

My present work at CU's ICS, funded by the <a href='https://www.colorado.edu/research/ai-institute/'>NSF National AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming</a>, is focused on leveraging discourse structure to improve classroom AI agents. By enforcing an understanding of discourse structure and dialogue acts, language models can be integrated more effectively and predictably in classroom settings, where there are many simultaneous participants whose intentions are often challenging to resolve.

At the University of Utah I'm currently studying decentralized content moderation with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/bkadiyala/home'>Bharadwaj Kadiyala</a>. Self-governing online communities largely determine their own rules, norms, and enforcement thereof. We are building data collection systems to study how these choices affect outcome variables like polarization, toxicity, posting activity, and free speech.
